Changes:
- removed trailing whitespaces


- look at the yield_comments impl
- decide if the yield needed here (will this help with async or not)?
- write "progress bar" either in yield_comments or in ...

• all this was done to learn async
• now i have working sync variant

progress bar can only be made if there is

I got comments by 100s.


### Idea:
one buffer of comments and all spawned threads working with async calls to
YT API append comments to that buffer.
Is it worth it at all to write async thing for downloading staff?

How should async code work:
1st level of threads to download threads of comments
and from this level new threads could be called to download the rest of comments
this is total overengineering for small videos, fuck it, i just want to pust
async program out where

If the whole list was returned from API there is no point to return elements one
by one. 
But that seems reasonable to yield the whole thing, because it can be ascuired
any moment

How to organize one queue to store all the nextPageTokens?
In the example, he created workers with the queue

so, threads in pool should ask for new videoId, till the moment they will 
receive
